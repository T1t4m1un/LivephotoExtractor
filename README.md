# Livephoto Extractor

## Description
Livephoto Extractor is a robust project aimed at enhancing the viewing of live photos from certain Android devices. Like the iPhone, some Android devices can capture live photos, which consist of a still image alongside a short, dynamic video. However, when these live photos are viewed on a PC, only the static image can be seen, and the accompanying video is inaccessible. The Livephoto Extractor project is dedicated to solving this issue, enabling the splitting of the still image and dynamic video parts of the live photo for a comprehensive viewing experience.

## Features
- **Live Photo Splitting:** This is the main feature of this project. It allows users to separate the static image from the dynamic video captured in a live photo. This way, users can enjoy the full content of their live photos on their PCs.

## Build and Compilation
This project uses CMake for project management. Here are the steps to build and compile the project using CMake on different platforms:

**Linux / MacOS:**

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `cmake .` to generate the Makefile.
3. Run `make` to build the project.

**Windows:**

1. Install CMake and a compiler of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio).
2. Open CMake GUI and set your "source directory" to your project and "where to build the binaries" to your desired directory (you can use the same directory as the source code).
3. Press "Configure" and select the generator for your compiler.
4. Press "Generate" to create the build files.
5. Open your build directory and open the generated solution file in your compiler, then build as usual.
